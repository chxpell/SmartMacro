<!-- Text between angle brackets is an HTML tag and is not displayed.

a page, come in pairs; some tags, like HR, for a horizontal rule, stand 
alone. Comments, such as the text you're reading, are not displayed when
the Web page is shown. The information between the HEAD and /HEAD tags is 
not displayed. The information between the BODY and /BODY tags is displayed.-->
